# Homebrew ImageMagick with X11 support

This is a macOS [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) [tap](https://docs.brew.sh/Taps) for ImageMagick with X11 support.

It tracks the upstream ImageMagick formula and enables the following:
- X11 support
- Graphviz support*

Updated on a [weekly](.github/workflows/weekly-update.yml) basis thanks to [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).

## How do I install this?
```
brew uninstall imagemagick  # without X11 support
brew install --cask xquartz
brew install tlk/imagemagick-x11/imagemagick
```

## Verify that it works
```
# Show the ImageMagick wizard in a window
display wizard:
```

*ImageMagick has support for [graphviz DOT-files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOT_(graph_description_language)) if the `--with-graphviz` option is used during install:
```
brew install tlk/imagemagick-x11/imagemagick --with-graphviz
convert mygraph.dot mygraph.png
```

## Updated every week
The formula is updated weekly which means that running `brew update && brew upgrade` will build and install the latest version.

Note that Homebrew has a ["pin" feature](https://docs.brew.sh/FAQ#how-do-i-stop-certain-formulae-from-being-updated) that will prevent `brew update && brew upgrade` from upgrading a particular piece of software:
```
brew pin tlk/imagemagick-x11/imagemagick
brew list --pinned
brew unpin tlk/imagemagick-x11/imagemagick  # allow it to be upgraded again
```
